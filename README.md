#### Project Setup: (in config.json)
> **Prefix:**
>
> For the premium system, there are no slash commands. You need to use prefix commands, so set your bot's prefix there.
>
> **Client ID:**
>
> This is very required for slash commands discord bot, please provide there your bot ID!
> 
> **Guild ID:**
>
> This is not required, this is only required if you are trying to **add** (not **edit**) a slash command. If you are trying to add a slash command, you need this variable and some configurations in the file index.js.
> 
> **Token:**
> 
> And yeah, the important thing for a discord bot. You need to provide your bot token there. If you are using VSCode (Visual Studio Code), use this configuration. Else if you are using Repl.it, use the new secret environments (The lock icon at your left of your screen), use the key **TOKEN** and the value is your bot token.
>
> **Emojis:**
>
> Just use some emojis. ü§™

#### Premium system and How it works:
> For this system, you need to your server members who invited your bot to their servers to **boost** your server, so you can add the premium feature for their server.
> The command is: `{prefix}premium [add/remove] [guild id]`
